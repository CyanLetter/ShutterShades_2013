# Shutter Shades

I built this portfolio in my senior year of art school at Western Carolina University. It landed me my first job at a design studio.

Back when I thought jQuery was synonymous with javascript.

Before I knew what version control was.

When life was thick with uncertainty and terror and excitement, in a better way than they are now.

Uploading this here so I can be nostalgic every once in a while.
